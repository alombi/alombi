# Hello. I'm alombi
Welcome to my GitHub page. Here you can find some informations about me and my projects.

Currently, I'm a student in Italy and I enjoy programming in my free time. I write JavaScript and some Python, and I really enjoy CSS (and SCSS as well), Svelte, Vue, Node and Flask.


## Projects
These are some of my usable and stable projects:
* [earthquakes](https://github.com/alombi/earthquakes): A web app for checking latest earthquakes in Italy, with interactive maps;
* [alombi.xyz](https://github.com/alombi/alombi.xyz): my personal website;
* [nyx](https://github.com/alombi/nyx): a tweak for jailbroken iOS devices that adds four beatiful pill widgets on the lock screen

## Contacts
My website is at [alombi.xyz](alombi.xyz) (and its source is at https://github.com/alombi/alombi.xyz).

You can find me on Twitter ([@alombi](https://twitter.com/al0mbi)) and on Reddit ([u/alelombi](https://www.reddit.com/user/alelombi))

## Jailbreak repo
If you are a jailbreaker, you can add my repo to Cydia: https://alombi.github.io/repo
