# Hello. I'm alombi
Welcome to my GitHub page. Here you can find some informations about me and my projects.

Currently, I'm a student in Italy and I enjoy programming in my free time.

The programming languages I know are JavaScript and Python, but I enjoy a lot writing some CSS too.
I also like web development, and so far I've used Node, Svelte, Vue, Flask and SCSS.

I'm thinking about learning Fastify (Node framework), Go or Swift. I know a bit of Julia for some data science and math stuff.

## Projects
These are my usable and stable projects:
* [earthquakes](https://github.com/alombi/earthquakes): A web app for checking latest earthquakes in Italy, with interactive maps;
* [alombi.xyz](https://github.com/alombi/alombi.xyz): my personal website;
* [nyx](https://github.com/alombi/nyx): a tweak for jailbroken iOS devices that adds four beatiful pill widgets on the lock screen

## Contacts
My website is at [alombi.xyz](alombi.xyz) (and its source it's at https://github.com/alombi/alombi.xyz).

You can find me on Twitter ([@alombi](https://twitter.com/al0mbi)) and on Reddit ([u/alelombi](https://www.reddit.com/user/alelombi))
